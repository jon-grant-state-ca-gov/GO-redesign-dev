              Governor Newsom is leading the global shift to our sustainable
              future -- more clean energy, less pollution. Governor Newsom's
              California Climate Commitment invests a record amount to achieve
              carbon neutrality by 2045, cut air pollution by 71%, and drop gas
              consumption by 94%, while creating 4 million new jobs, through
              critical climate solutions. Under the Newsom Administration,
              California is leading the global transition to zero emission
              vehicles, requiring all new cars sold to be zero-emission by 2035.
              The state surpassed 1.5 million ZEVs sold in California in 2023,
              two years ahead of schedule.

              Under Governor Newsom, California has made major investments in
              local law enforcement and prosecutors to combat violent crime. The
              Governor is deploying a Public Safety Plan backed by a record
              investment to:

            <ul>

              Part of the Public Safety Plan includes a multi-year recruitment

              The Newsom Administration has stayed laser-focused on fighting the
              opioid crisis, particularly the scourge of fentanyl. Governor
              Newsom has invested $7.9 million in 2022-23 and $6.7 million
              ongoing in a new Fentanyl Enforcement Program and $30 million to
              expand the Military Department’s existing drug interdiction
              efforts. Over 62,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized by the
              California National Guard in 2023, a 116% increase in seizures
              since 2022. Additionally, California is cracking down on opioid
              use and preventing overdoses through $151 million for the Naloxone
              Distribution project, $61 million for prevention and harm
              reduction, $10 million for education, testing, recovery, and
              support services, $4 million to make more test strips available,
              and $3.5 million to provide overdose medication to all middle and
              high schools, and making naloxone in a nasal form a targeted drug
              for CalRx medication accessibility initiative.

              middle class individuals. The Governor also announced the CalRx

              its own generic drug label, and announced efforts to make insulin
              and Naloxone more affordable.

                generate $160 million annually on the sale of bullets to improve

                the definition of a firearm to include ghost gun parts; and

              Governor Newsom is tackling California’s homelessness crisis
              head-on. No more excuses, no more passing the buck – California is
              finally getting serious about this decades-long emergency with the
              compassion and urgency it demands. The Newsom Administration has
              invested $2.2 billion through the Behavioral Health Continuum
              Infrastructure Program to build approximately 2,500 behavioral
              health beds and create thousands of treatment slots to serve the
              needs of Californians with mental health and substance use
              challenges. To better treat those experiencing crisis, the
              Governor created the Mobile Crisis Response program, investing
              $1.4 billion over five years so that people experiencing
              behavioral health crises, receive coordinated, more timely
              behavioral health care through Medi-Cal. Additionally, Governor
              Newsom signed legislation to modernize California’s
              conservatorship laws for the first time in more than 50 years and
              created CARE Court, a new framework to provide care, services, and
              housing to individuals with the most serious, untreated mental
              health and substance use disorders. The Governor has also expanded
              funding for the treatment of substance use disorder by leveraging
              over $200 million in federal opioid-related funding to support the
              Medication Assisted Treatment Expansion Project.

              compassion and urgency it demands. The Governor has invested over

              unprecedented accountability from local governments to make sure
              these investments have the intended effects. The Governor has also
              pioneered nation-leading homeless housing reforms, including
              Homekey and Project Roomkey, which have brought more than 71,000
              people off the streets. Additionally, California is investing $750
              million in Encampment Resolution Funding to get people out of
              encampments and into housing, and is delivering up to 1,200 small
              homes to provide safe, interim housing for people experiencing
              homelessness, free of charge and ready for occupancy.
